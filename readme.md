# DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems that I have solved from various sources, including LeetCode and interview online assessments (OAs). The problems are organized by topic to make it easier to find and review solutions for specific areas of DSA.

## Topics Covered
- Two Pointers
- Binary Search
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Graphs
- Linked Lists
- Maps & Hashing
- Math
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Sorting
- Strings
- Trees

## Folder Structure
Each folder corresponds to a DSA topic and contains C++ solutions to relevant problems. The filenames usually include the problem number and title for easy reference.

```
2pointer/           # Two pointer problems
Binary Search/      # Binary search problems
Dp/                 # Dynamic programming problems
Graph/              # Graph algorithms
Interview Questions/# OA and interview-specific questions
LinkedList/         # Linked list problems
Map/                # Hashing and map-based problems
Math/               # Math-related problems
Recursion/          # Recursion and backtracking
Sorting/            # Sorting algorithms
String/             # String manipulation problems
Tree/               # Tree algorithms
```

## Sources
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- Various interview and OA platforms

## How to Use
Browse the folders to find solutions to specific types of problems. Each file contains a self-contained C++ solution with the problem number and title for reference.
